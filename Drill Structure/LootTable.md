# Loot Table

I decided to make a table to show what the percentage odds of different drops are in different places because it's hard to tell in the code. The way I program the drill's drops I calculated the odds of each category of loot first before I then calculated the odds of each individual item within the category so you aren't immediately able to tell what the odds really are. You'll noticed some odds change slightly between biomes, which is because of the fact that they have additional biome specific drops they get added.

### Percent Chances

Keep in mind you're always guaranteed to get stone

### Quantities
There isn't any deviation between quanitities except for getting more sand from the Desert (which is shown in parantheses). This is the **base** amount that you get. The drill's drop quantities is affected by lighthouses.
