# Forager Mod: Drill Structure
## Steam Listing: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2027044993
Adds a drill that is unlocked when you obtain the Drilling skill, which initially costs 2 Electronics and 5 Steel to build. It's intended to "automate" dig spots by giving you another way to obtain those resources in a way that is also arguably easier.

Every 5 seconds it will drop resources at random with different odds for different items. It will always drop stone and can also drop basically anything else that dig spots can drop, plus some additional resources like obsidian and crystals. Drops are biome specific, so building a drill in the grass biome means you can get a fossil, while building it in the winter biome measn you can get crystals and frozen relics. You also get more sand from drills in the desert. Also the drops are affected by lighthouses!

UPDATE 1: The issue with resources not dropping from the drill when it is off screen is fixed, it will now always drop resources whether is it off screen or not!

UPDATE 2: The drill now has an animation, courtesy of SMETTBO!

UPDATE 3: Added unlocking Drills to the description for Drilling

You can use my mod in any shape or form however you want as long as you credit me. The drop rates and amounts you see in the images are what I calculated in the LootTable.md file.
